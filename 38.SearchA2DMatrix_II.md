### Search a 2D Matrix II<h1>
### Description:<h2>
> Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix, return the occurrence of it.  
>This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted from up to bottom.
- No duplicate integers in each row or column.

### Example <h3>
Consider the following matrix:  
[
  [1, 3, 5, 7],
  [2, 4, 7, 8],
  [3, 5, 9, 10]
]
Given target = 3, return 2.

### Challenge <h4>
> O(m+n) time and O(1) extra space

### Solution<h5>
- Search the matrix from the right-up position, since the integers in each row are sorted form left to right.
- Then flow down. 
- If the value of right position is smaller than target, ignore this row;
- When the value of the right position is bigger than target, search from the right for target; and count it in;
- return counts;
### Code: <h6>
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param matrix: A list of lists of integers
     * @param target: An integer you want to search in matrix
     * @return: An integer indicate the total occurrence of target in the given matrix
     */
    int searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>> &matrix, int target) 
    {
        // write your code here
        if(matrix.empty())return 0;
        int row= matrix.size();
        int col=matrix[0].size();
        int counts=0;
        for(int i=0;i<row;i++)
        {
            if(matrix[i][col-1]<target)
            continue;
            for(int j=col-1;j>=0;j--)
            {
                if(matrix[i][j]==target)
                counts++;
            }
        }
        return counts;
    }
};
```
